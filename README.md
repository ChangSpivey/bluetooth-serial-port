# bluetooth-rs
Rust library for interacting with the Bluetooth stack

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RAOF/bluetooth-rs.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/RAOF/bluetooth-rs)

Currently very simple; just enough to provide a MIO-based BluetoothSocket struct and connect() to an already-paired Bluetooth device.
